# 709-WeekOne

During the readings, videos, and exercises I learned a lot about the definitions and formal names for what was happening in the code. Experiencing Java for the first time it was
helpful to see what a word meant in the English language versus what it means in Java. 

Honestly it was a lot more complicated to set up the digital environment than to actually do the exercises. Once I downloaded and connected the appropriate files everything 
made more sense. I imagine as this class continues it’ll be easier to use the platforms and code more seamlessly. 

It was interesting how specific you had to be especially when it came to using integers, strings, and different operations. Coming from a math background I 
appreciated how Java goes in the order of operations, but when it came to rounding only the first number before the decimal point would apply. 

Coding in a new language I relearned how frustrating it is when you are trying to figure out a bug or the final product isn’t what you expected it turned out to be. 
To my future students it would be helpful to share different ways I used to debug my code or different resources to help find what I was looking for. 

I definitely need more time getting used to the language and understanding what each part of the code does. Taking out one piece of code at a time and seeing the outcome was 
helpful in chapter one, but I envision myself doing more research on my own to understand more of the basics of Java.
